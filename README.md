# Background
Continuation of the [PetDetective](https://github.com/vladimir-ionita/PetDetective) project. This is not really part of the project, but I've starting having thoughts parsing the map automatically. 

The process of creating the map representation was quite tedious. Although, this was not part of the project, I thought it's a good idea to make the process faster by parsing the map automatically. It's far from the project purpose, but the topic of image processing was always in my head. Unfortunately I didn't have the time for it.
